![](images/airport.png)As I had mentioned in a preview post, I've been working on a mac mini MythTV frontend. The only current issue I have is streaming HD content over 802.11n. My first attempt worked great as long as I didn't move the mini to a different room than the router. I'm learning a bit more about wireless networking as I go along here, essentially, my 'old' router operates in the 2.4 Ghz range which is significantly more crowded than the 5 Ghz range, so I'm going to test out a 5Ghz router this weekend, and see what I can get.  
  
Another possibility is to transcode the HD to SD (which is the quality I would be viewing it anyway) and stream that. I don't want to outright replace my HD content (I still watch it in HD downstairs afterall), so I might set up a User Job to transcode it, and place an entry in the MythTV database for a 'second' show.
