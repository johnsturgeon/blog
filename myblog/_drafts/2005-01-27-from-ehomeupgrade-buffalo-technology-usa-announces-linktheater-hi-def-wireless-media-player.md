[eHomeUpgrade | Buffalo Technology USA Announces LinkTheater Hi-Def Wireless Media Player](http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/525/buffalo_technology_usa)  
  
Buffalo Technology releases a Wireless Hi-Def DVD/Media player which support DivX, DivX HD, and WMV. A quick look at the press release tells me that it will be available the beginning of February for roughly $350.00 (US). This puts it about $100 more than the [IO-Data AvelLink player](http://www.sturgeonfamily.com/2005/01/divx-networks-say-hd-dvd-is-ready-now.php). It's hard to see at this point if they have a Linux server or not, so we'll have to play a bit of wait and see, but it sure would be nice to get a cheap HDTV front end for my High-Def programs captured with MythTV. If the price point drops to the $150 range, then I could see putting one in my family room, and one in the bedroom.
