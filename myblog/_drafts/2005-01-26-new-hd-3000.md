A few friends and I have taken a leap. We are putting together an order of 8 HD-3000 High Definition recording cards before the famous Broadcast Flag stuff becomes Law (June?).  
  
Right now, each of us are ordering two each, and I plan on eventually building a seperate backend with at least .5 Terabytes of storage. I still plan on transcoding to smaller resolution, but long term, I think the idea is to build enough disk space and tweak my front end to be able to play HDTV natively without the transcoding mess.
