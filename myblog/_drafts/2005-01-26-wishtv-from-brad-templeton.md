From Brad Templeton's weblog: [Brad Ideas: Changing the nature of TV again](http://ideas.4brad.com/archives/000174.html)  
  
He has written a perl script to create a wishlist for MythTV. It is a great idea, and has far more features and functionality than the 'WishList' feature of TiVo. I haven't tried it out yet, but I'd be interested to use it. My only critique of the concept in general, is that I would now have two places to manage my programming needs (MythTV's guide, and WishTV).
