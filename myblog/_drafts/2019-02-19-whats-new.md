As you might have noticed, it's been a while since I've updated my blog. Back towards the end of 2009, I made a job switch. The first couple years at my new job were demanding enough that a lot of my side projects dropped to the wayside. I couldn't stay away from tinkering with things for long though, mostly my attention has moved to automation, home, Mac, and iOS automation. I thought this would also be a good time to start the blog back up again.
