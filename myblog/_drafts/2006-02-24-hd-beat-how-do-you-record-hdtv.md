Here are the results of a poll that HDBeat did recently which shows just how people are recording their HDTV. The thing I find interesting is the behind Satellite, Cable, and Windows Media Center, lies Mythtv. I didn't participate in the poll (only 23 mythtv HDTV folks out there did), but my little vote wouldn't have changed the results much.
