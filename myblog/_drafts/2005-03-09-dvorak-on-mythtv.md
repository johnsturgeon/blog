John C. Dvorak has written a small bit on MythTV for pcmag.com. There's nothing earth shattering or revealing in his writings, but simply having Dvorak write about MythTV is yet another step bringing the 'future' technology to the masses.

> [Opinion Column by PC Magazine: The Secret TV Revolution](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1763060,00.asp): "Everyone I know who has ever seen or played with MythTV wants it, but it's a do-it-yourself project and not for the timid. Eventually that will change as packagers appear and bundle prebuilt systems together.  
>   
> There are other implications of all this. In a changing universe, technologists will refuse to be hemmed in by artificial roadblocks created for the purpose of maintaining the status quo. Microsoft and Hollywood and whoever else can create all the DRM schemes they want; they can sue college kids for trading songs, block trading networks, shut down BitTorrent systemsâ€”but it won't do them any good. The forces of 'We want it our way' will overpower them again and again, because that's the way technology works.  
>   
> And this will all be shared. In a networked, computer-based world, the sense of community breeds a socialistic desire to share, not covet. This mentality is at the root of all the open-source activity and cannot be ignored or denied. I want my MythTV."
