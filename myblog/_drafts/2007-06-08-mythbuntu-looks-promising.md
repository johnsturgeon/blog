I just ran across a new distribution of mythtv in a box (_along with [MythDora](http://g-ding.tv/) and [KnoppMyth](http://www.mysettopbox.tv/knoppmyth.html)_) called [MythBuntu](http://www.mythbuntu.org/) and I plan on giving it a test run this weekend. The project is currently in alpha. One nice thing is that they offer a live cd version so that you can simply drop in a disk and run a mythtv frontend anywhere you want (we'll have to see how well that one works!). Lirc is not available yet, so it won't be an option for me in terms of actually replacing my FC5 frontend, but I can't imagine it will be too long before they get that working.
