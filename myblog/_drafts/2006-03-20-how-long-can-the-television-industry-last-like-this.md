I just finished reading the stuff about the music industry and how artists are now considered more 'in control' of their own destiny, and the entire distribution model that was in place is falling apart, and I'm wondering just how far we are from a parallel thing happening with the Television industry. I see the film industry leading the way on this front, as they seem to be more accepting of independant artists. Perhaps it may never happen because Television isn't considered 'art'. Therefore, and 'indepenant' TV producer would never happen.
