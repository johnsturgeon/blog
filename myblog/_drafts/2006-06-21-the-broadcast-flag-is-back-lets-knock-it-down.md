I got my EFF Action Alert in my inbox this AM, and sure enough, the broadcast flag has jumped up again. This is the text from the newsletter:  

>   
> "The Communications, Consumers Choice, and Broadband  
> Deployment Act of 2006 is a monster name for a monster bill  
> \-- in its latest form, it contains 159 pages of densely  
> plotted telecommunications reform. But while politicians  
> struggle with its major clauses, the RIAA and MPAA have  
> piggybacked their own agenda: the broadcast and audio flags,  
> which restrict innovation and legitimate use of recorded  
> digital radio and TV content. Your call today could force  
> the flags to find a home of their own.  
>   
> The Committee markup of this bill is on Thursday, and your  
> Senator is on the Commerce Committee. One last push from  
> you could get Congress to remove the entertainment industry  
> mandates from the bill."  

  
  
The call to action is to either call or write your Senator. They make the process of writing your Senator **incredibly** easy by providing [a form](https://secure.eff.org/site/Advocacy?JServSessionIdr003=owevg7uso1.app13b&cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=223) that you can fill out, and they provide sample text for the e-mail. I can tell you that they do get the message so I encourage you to write.
