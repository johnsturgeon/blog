The [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](http://www.eff.org/) has done a great job fighting for the consumers rights in a digital age.  As a member, I've been very proud to support this organization and what they have accomplished.  Currently they are trying to get the word out about the Sony BMG Settlement.   
  
Here's a snippet from their newsletter:  
  

> EFF's campaign to help music fans claim their share of the  
> Sony BMG settlement is off to a great start. News reports  
> and EFF's settlement banners have spread around the web,  
> driving over 20,000 hits to our settlement site in one week.  
>   
> Help us keep the momentum going. Sony BMG won't be held  
> accountable for infecting its customers' computers with  
> dangerous DRM if music fans don't learn about the flawed  
> software, the settlement, and how to submit claims. EFF has  
> created a webpage to guide people through the Sony BMG  
> settlement site, and we've designed several banners that  
> link to this webpage. By posting a banner on your website or  
> blog, you can help music fans protect themselves and get  
> what they deserve.
