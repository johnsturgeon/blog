I've got some new hardware for an updated front end, and I'm dying to get it up and running on the new version of MythTV (0.17) and Fedora Core 3. It's a Shuttle [SN95G5](http://global.shuttle.com/Product/Barebone/SN95G5.asp) with 1Gig of Ram, two 300Gig SATA drives and one 250Gig external (total .85 TBytes). nVidia GeForce 6600GT Vid card, pcHDTV HD-3000 High Definition capture card, Dual Layer DVD Writer and AMD 64 3200+ CPU.  
  
Only one problem. [Fedora Core 3 won't install on SATA drives attached to nForce motherboards....](http://www.nforcershq.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=57794)  
  
The workaround is anything but elegant, and if I am able to make any progress at all, I'll keep y'all up to date.
