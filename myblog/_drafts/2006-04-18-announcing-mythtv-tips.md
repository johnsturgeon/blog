I'm introducing a new section of the site: [MythTV Tips](http://www.myhdbox.com/mythtips/). I'm kicking off this blog after assembling several questions (both mine, and from others) about how to actually use MythTV. There are SOOOOO many features in MythTV, some documented well, and some.. not so much. I am going to use this site to publish my personal tips, tricks, tutorials for MythTV.

Feel free to comment with any questions you have, and I'll do my best to answer.

Update: February 19, 2019

I'm no longer running my MythTV Tips blog. I need to consolidate down to one blog, and this is it.
