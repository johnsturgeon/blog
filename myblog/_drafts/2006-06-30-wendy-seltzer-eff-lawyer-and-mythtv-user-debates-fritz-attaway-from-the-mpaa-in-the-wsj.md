title: "Wendy Seltzer, EFF Lawyer and MythTV user debates Fritz Attaway from the MPAA in the WSJ"

When Fritz Attaway starts out the entire debate with this line:  

>   
> **_Attaway:_**"Digital rights management is the key to consumer choice..."  

  
He then goes on to explain how by being able to control the content, and how it can be distributed, and used, the movies studio's can get a return on the millions they made to make a movie. See how much better that is for us? It occurred to me that he really believes that.  
  
Wendy replies that the DMCA stifles technological innovation, and she describes that there are still no legal solutions for viewing DVD's on her Linux computer (go Wendy). Then she throws him this:  

>   
> **_Seltzer:_**"DRM plus DMCA protects existing business models, such as that of the blockbuster movie, but at the expense of new developments that could create more value for both creators and users of content. In the era of podcasts and YouTube, I'm quite interested in seeing what those users can do as they become creators."  

  
What she's getting at here is that if the MPAA continues down their current path people will find ways around **them**, not just DRM.  
  
Over and over again, Fritz stresses that any possible innovation around Media technologies that are disallowed because of current DRM are completely acceptable because it's more important that the studios make money.  
  

>   
> **_Fritzie:_**"'Transformative' uses are fine, but they cannot be given priority over the incentive to create new works. A central tenet of our fair use doctrine is that fair uses do not interfere with the ability of the creator to exploit the economic value of her work."  

  
I don't know about you, but it seems clear to me he knows exactly who pays his bills.  
  
The debate rages on, and is a [must read](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB115047057428882434-MUsR0YpdgWWx3dA5V_E7llNqZoM_20070620.html?mod=blogs).
