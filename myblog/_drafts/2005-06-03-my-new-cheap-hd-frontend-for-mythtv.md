I've just purchased the [IO-Data AvelLink Player](http://www.iodata.com/products/products.php?cat=HNP&sc=AVEL&ts=2&tsc=15&sc=AVEL&pId=AVLP2%2FDVDLA). It's a High-Definition Network Media player which also plays DVD's (standard DVD's as well as any other media file including MPEG4-HD files!). It has a D4 digital output (which is a standard in Japan) and comes with a D4 to Component dongle. All for just $249.00. I haven't received it yet, but when I do, I'll do a write-up on it. I touched on it before in [this](http://www.sturgeonfamily.com/2005/01/divx-networks-say-hd-dvd-is-ready-now.php) entry. The thing that really put it over the edge for me is that they released a Linux version of their AvelLink Server.
