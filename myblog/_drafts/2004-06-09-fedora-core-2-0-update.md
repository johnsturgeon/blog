I'm still waiting to upgrade to Fedora Core 2.0, for two reasons.  

  
2. The nvidia driver does not compile against the native kernel  
    
3. I haven't had the time  
    

  
But as soon as Both of those things change, I'll definintely upgrade. I have been quite successfully transcoding some shows, but others have the strangest interlacing problems that I haven't been able to solve.
