My MythTV frontend on a Mac Mini experiment just moved up to a new level. My downstairs, full-time, home-built, ubuntu frontend died. The mac just got promoted from a part-time upstairs frontend, to a full time downstairs big tv frontend. I have been a bit hesitant really promoting the mythtv on a mac experiment, but now that I've had it downstairs and up front for about a week, I can say that I'm very impressed. Here are some of the things I like about the mini:  

- Small
- Silent
- I can run far more useful applications with the same remote as mythtv than I could with my Linux box
- did i say small?

  
The third bullet (all the applications I can run) deserves some attention, and I'm going to do a separate post on just that topic. Here are a few things I don't like (so far...)  

- I haven't been able to resize the screen to non-native resolutions without getting skippy playback. Which means.. overscan.. and lots of it.
- The mac remote has 6 buttons (3 are overloaded, so there are really 9). That's enough for 95% of the everyday use, but not for more advanced tasks.

  
As I mentioned above, the possibilities are broad and wide when it comes to now integrating MythTV with other Mac multimedia apps. Here is a short list.  

- Hulu Desktop
- Frontrow
- Itunes
- Netflix Watch Now
- Better games

  
As I begin putting all this together into one monster media machine, I'll make sure to document the pitfalls, how-to's etc... along the way for anybody who wants to go down this path.
