Not much going on lately, except that now that the summer is here, I get to clear out the backlog of shows that I recorded but didn't watch. Including the entire season of Alias! It should actually be a fun summer. I find my viewing habits have changed so much with MythTV (or any PVR for that matter). I don't feel the need to 'keep up' with shows any longer, with the exception of a couple reality TV shows.
