G-Tech is going to release a line of 'Black Box' media players called [G-Play](http://g-technology.com/Products/G-PLAY.cfm). I took a look at the site, and it looks like a nice alternative to network media players. Imagine, you don't have a network, but you want to be able to play your HD content wherever you are. Just sync this thing up with your Video files captured on your PC, disconnect, and hook it up to your TV through it's Component adapter. Bang.. High Definition playback.
