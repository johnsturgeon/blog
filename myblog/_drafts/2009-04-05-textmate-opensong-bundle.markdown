Our Music Worship Team at church uses [OpenSong](http://www.opensong.org/), opensource Worship Planning software, but one of my frustrations has been that it's music editor is not the best. I've also been getting a bit deeper into [TextMate](http://macromates.com/); more specifically, bundles. I've recently put together an OpenSong bundle which primarily allows for better syntax highlighting, but also has a 'new file' snippet for creating a new OpenSong file.

It's a work in progress, so as I modify it, I'll be sure to keep it updated.
