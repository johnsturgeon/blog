I just ran across this site: [StormLogic, LLC's MythTV Store - Contributed Code](http://mythic.tv/contributed_code.php) where there are a few bits of interesting code for MythTV.  
  
The two I find the most interesting are DVB Fixer Scripts:  

>   
> "DVB fixer scripts v1.1, used to automate the manual process of using an HD-3000 card with the DVB drivers"  

  
and mplayer-resume.pl  

>   
> "mplayer-resumer.pl, a wrapper for mplayer that remembers where you left off."  

  
  
When much of my time watching transcoded HDTV shows was spent using mplayer instead of the internal player, I was always frustrated by the lack of a 'bookmark' capability in mplayer. The mplayer-resume.pl script is a nice workaround to that problem.
