> _A player from I-O data is already available for $250, and they expect DivX-capable players to drop to around $100 within a year (whatâ€™s odd about the Times piece is that they neglect to mention that there are actually a lot of players out there that support DivX, the big deal about the I-O Data player is that it supports the high-def version of DivX)._

I checked out the player as a possible alternate simple frontend for MythTV and unfortunately, they don't have a Linux client which serves the content. I think it is only a matter of time before this kind of thing is common place, and can act as a cheap front end for MythTV which you can drop in just about any room that you want.  
  
**UPDATE:** I got an e-mail back from them saying that they will be releasing a Linux version of their Media File Server. This has once again become a very interesting option for a remote (second/third/etc...) front end for a MythTV backend.
