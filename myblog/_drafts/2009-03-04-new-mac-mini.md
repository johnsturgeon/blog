The new mac mini has been released, and we've decided to go ahead and use it for a second frontend for the MythTV backend. Not that we're big TV watchers, but having a second frontend upstairs gives us a chance to hole up upstairs when sick/etc... and watch the same programs as downstairs. We'll see how streaming HD over 802.11n goes!
