The [online TV Recorder](http://www.onlinetvrecorder.com/welcome.php). You log in, program your show to record, then download the recorded show. This appears to be a community driven site based in Germany, along the same line as [Rent My DVR](http://www.rentmydvr.com/eng/index.asp)  
  
I'd love to see something like this come to the US, but there would have to be a few questions answered first:  
  

  
- What is the legal ramification?
  
- What are the service limitations
  
- What is the revenue model (if any)
  
- What is the quality of the download
  

  
  
Thoughts? Feel free to comment
