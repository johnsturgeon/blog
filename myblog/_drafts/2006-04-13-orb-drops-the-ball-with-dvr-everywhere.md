Just caught this on [PVR Wire](http://www.pvrwire.com/2006/04/13/orb-releases-dvr-everywhere-tivo-on-the-go/):  

>   
> Orb Networks has released their new DVR Everywhere software, allowing TiVo users to access content directly from their Series 2 box anywhere in the world over an Internet connection.  

  
Not sure why the good folks over at PVR Wire say that this would work with "Presumably any other networked PVR", everything I see on the site says 'TiVo only'. It's really a pity, because Orb had previously managed to stay away from any platform specific media sources. I see this as a step in the wrong direction for them.
