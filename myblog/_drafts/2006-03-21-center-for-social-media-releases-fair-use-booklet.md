Joshua Paul blogged about Fair Use over at O'Reilly Digital Media. I jumped over to [the link](http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/fairuse.htm) he mentions in his blog and found a wonderful description (and an 8 page booklet with more detail) of Fair use.

> "Fair Use is the right, in some circumstances, to quote copyrighted material without asking permission or paying for it. It is a crucial feature of copyright law. In fact, it is what keeps copyright from being censorship. You can invoke fair use when the value to the public of what you are saying outweighs the cost to the private owner of the copyright."
