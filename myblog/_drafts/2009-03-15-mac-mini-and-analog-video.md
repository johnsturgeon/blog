Well, it seems in Apple's infinite wisdom that they've dropped support for analog video in the newest mini. After pounding through forums and what-not, I've discovered the same issue exists for the macbook pro's as well. Unfortunately, that will lead me to the purchase of a VGA -> S-Video adapter. More on that later, as I continue my quest for a turnkey MythTV frontend.
