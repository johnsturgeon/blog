Andrew Turner on High Earth Orbit has written a [nice essay](http://highearthorbit.com/index.php?p=147) on the future of television. Here is an excerpt:  

> In the end, this sharing is happening, and based on how effective the MPAA, RIAA, and other entities have been in fighting this sharing, I doubt it will go away anytime soon. Therefore, I believe the video industry has an excellent chance to embrace these technologies to broaden their market reach and customer interest.

  
I wholeheartedly agree with his perspective. I remain, unfortunately, pessimistic. I think it's somewhat idealistic to think that the industry will embrace the new technologies.
