O.K. Maybe I took liberties with the title, but Bruce Shankle does a side-by-side comparison between Windows MCE, and MythTV. It's not a feature comparison, but rather an installation, ease-of-use, comparison. He does get a bit into what he considers his key feature (the ability to watch **and** rip a DVD) where MythTV is the clear winner. My favorite quote from [the article](http://bruceshankle.blogspot.com/2006/04/windows-media-center-vs-mythtv-or.html):  

> I try again, same thing. It can't play the DVD. After hours of Googling I learn that I have to buy a piece of software (a DVD decoder) that let's Media Center play DVDs. I'm thinking 'WTF? Media Center can't play DVD's out of the box?'  
>   
> That's right. If you want that feature you have pay for it.
