Well, I know it's been a while since I've posted. I've been a busy camper, and this blog hasn't quite risen to the top of my todo list in a while. I was re-reading my past posts, and noticed that the theme has been my thoughts about switch from Fedora Core to Ubuntu. An update is that I made the switch a few months ago, and haven't looked back. Ubuntu comes with all the mythtv packages that I use and was incredibly easy to set up for both my backend, and my frontend systems.  
  
My current system is Gutsy (7.10) and I used the guides from the Ubuntu community docs for setting up mythtv (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MythTV). No big gotchas for me, even with my HD setup.
