This is huge. I'm not quite sure that it's over yet. I'm inclined to think that there will be appeals, but at this point, things are looking up.  
  
Congratulations, and thanks go to [Brad Templeton](http://ideas.4brad.com/) and [Wendy Seltzer](http://wendy.seltzer.org/blog/) (and all the other folks at the EFF who worked their tails off for this result).
