I just got back from a vacation with the family. 2,000 miles in two weeks with a four and seven year old in the back.  
  
Of course, no major road trip would be complete (or even possible these days) unless you provide some kind entertainment. When I was a kid, that consisted of hours on end of singing "I've been working on the railroad", and playing every possible variant of I-Spy (I spy something that starts with the letter P --- Peterbilt -- again...). But for somebody with MythTV on the brain, you have to think a bit outside the box. Enter [LaCie's Silverscreen](http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10480).![](images/hd_silverscreen.jpg). I won't go into a major review here, but this little guy can output up to 1080i via component, it also outputs S-Video, and composite, and can play almost every popular video format. We hooked it up to a pair of 7" TFT displays strapped to the back of our headrests, and the kids had more shows than they could possibly watch during the trip. Where did the shows come from? MythTV + nuvexport to Xvid format. Being able to take my content on the road with me in a totally open format is one of the great advantages to MythTV. I know there are other commercial solutions available, but since they are all closed source, you need to use proprietary solutions which are either more expensive, or have less features.
