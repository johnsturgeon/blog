I think the 'first' they're claiming is that the device is a Media server, as well as a player. The LinkPlayer is not a server. Personally, I like more flexibility in my server. My feeling is that with no recording capabilities, it will be relatively useless as a server, and with only 100G it will not be able to act as a storage device for all media. It will either be used only as a wireless HD player (which LinkPlayer among others already do) or it will get stuck in the middle and die a horrible death.
