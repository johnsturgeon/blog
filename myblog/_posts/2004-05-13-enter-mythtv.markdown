In order to view TV through a Linux based HDTV you need a solid client. I wanted something similar to my Dish Network PVR (the 721) where I could do things like pause live TV, record shows from a guide, etc... There are a couple projects out there that seemed interesting; Freevo, and MythTV. MythTV is a much more active current project, and since HDTV is a newer technology, I decided (good decision) to go with that.  
  
[MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/) is amazing, and I can't even begin to scratch the surface of what it's capable of doing here. Instead, I'll put a link, and anybody interested in learning more, check it out.
