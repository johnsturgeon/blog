I'm retiring my old wordpress blog (over at [http://myhdbox.com](http://myhdbox.com)), and now I begin
the slow process of migrating each post over.  

There are a lot of guides, and a lot of ways to automatically pull posts over, but to be honest, 
I prefer a nice, slow, manual process where I can curate the `frontmatter` and make sure that the
posts look good before bringing them over.

That's why I chose this method: [Convert WordPress to Markdown - wpXSS](https://wpxss.com/wp-content/convert-wordpress-to-markdown/)

So, over the next few days / weeks I'll be bringing over all 93 posts over the last 18 years :), starting
with my first post: [Where to Start?]({% post_url 2004-05-12-where-to-start %})
