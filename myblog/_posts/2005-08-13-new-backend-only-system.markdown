I'm in the process of putting together an exclusive backend only system. When I get a chance, I'll put the specs together here, but basically, I'm going for a three HD tuner (HD-3000) six drive system running Fedora Core 4. I'm starting out with two tuners and two 400 Gig Drives but the case I got expands to six drives which is going to be key for a Heavy Duty HD Backend system.  
  
Coupled with my Shuttle front-end in the Family Room, and my Avel LinkPlayer II upstairs, I'm transitioning to a distributed media architecture which should suit the family well in the future.
