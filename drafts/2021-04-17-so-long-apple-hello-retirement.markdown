# So long Apple.  Hello Retirement

![](images/Apple_logo_black-1.png)

Yesterday was my last day at Apple and I'm calling it a day on a 30+ year career (HP and Apple). I've been very fortunate to work in an area that I have really enjoyed (Software Engineer). I've also been fortunate to work with some amazing people over the years. I very much look forward to moving into this next phase of my life with my lovely wife doing.. well.. who knows what.

I'm definitely going to continue to program, and folks can always see what I'm up to at my [Github Profile](https://github.com/johnsturgeon){:target="_blank"}
