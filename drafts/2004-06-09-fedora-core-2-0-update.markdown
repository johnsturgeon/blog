# Fedora Core 2.0 update
I'm still waiting to upgrade to Fedora Core 2.0, for two reasons.  

1. The nvidia driver does not compile against the native kernel
2. I haven't had the time
  
But as soon as both of those things change, I'll definitely upgrade. I have been quite successfully 
transcoding some shows, but others have the strangest interlacing problems that I haven't been able to solve.
