Over the past year I've been gradually migrating all my hardware from home-built linux boxes to Macs (Mac Mini's specifically). I'm still keeping my separate MythTV frontend/backend setup. I'm using a Mini as my backend in the office, and a Mini as my frontend in the family room. I'm going to do a couple different posts, describing my frontend configuration, and my backend configuration. Each has it's own interesting twists, but overall, I wanted to get back into my blog, and try and help folks who might be going down the same path (going Apple).  
  
Next post... my frontend.
