I've finally gone and done it. I've purchased a new mac mini for an upstairs MythTV frontend. MythTV runs well on Mac OS X so I figured I'd give it a shot. I've never experienced anything quite as easy as this. The Mac Mini is the \*perfect\* MythTV frontend. I've unboxed (always fun with Apple products), plugged it in, gone through initial Leopard setup, and downloaded the precompiled dmg from [The Snider Pad](http://www.thesniderpad.com/index.php?option=com_remository&Itemid=42). I have my backend broadcasting itself as a UPnP Media Server, so when I fired up Mythfrontend.app on the mac for the first time, it found it right away. Once it connected, I was done. There were all my shows. Of course, the first thing I did was go straight to some of my traditionally difficult HD content, and it played it back flawlessly.  
  
Now onto the next steps  

- I streamed HD over 802.11n in the same room as the router, I need a real-world test upstairs
- The apple remote worked out of the box, but only has six buttons. The nice thing about MythTV is you can remap the buttons, but six... hmm... just not quite enough. I'll need to find out if there is another remote that can work. I might go down the lirc path

Bottom Line  
  
This was such a pleasant experience and the mini is soooooooooo silent that I'm counting the days until my monstrous 4 year old media PC dies in the family room! Another project might be to figure out what the most compatible tuner's are for a mac and kill my loud backend in the office. I've been impressed with MythTV on a Mac OS X. I hope to write some apple friendly applescripts/automator actions to do some fun things that I've been dying to do.
