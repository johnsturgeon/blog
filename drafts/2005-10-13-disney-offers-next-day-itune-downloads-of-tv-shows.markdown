# Disney offers next-day iTunes downloads of TV shows

> [Disney offers next-day iTunes downloads of TV shows](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/12/AR2005101201813.html): "Opening the door to a new revenue stream for television content, the Walt Disney Co. said on Wednesday it will begin offering next-day digital downloads of its biggest ABC prime time hits for $1.99 per episode."

**$1.99 per episode?!?!?** Bwahahahaha! Just how much do they think this crap is worth? That's as ridiculous as $.99 per song for music. My price point? $.05/song $0.15/hour of TV. And it damn well better be High-Def!
