# Marketing in the age of Ad-Zapping

The Australian has a nice piece on the Marketing perspective of ad-zapping. The quote below, to me, is a fundamental reality that over the air networks are going to have to come to grips with in the not too distant future. The question is, will they go down kicking and screaming like the RIAA, or will they learn to somehow embrace technology and turn this into an advantage... My bet's on the former. My guess is that we are going to be sued and legislated into watching commercials. The big networks are going to turn us all into criminals.

> "Though 2005 will not see the death of the 30-second television commercial, it may prove to be the beginning of the end of free-to-air television as the automatic answer to a marketing challenge. The risk-averse marketing industry will be forced to re-evaluate its own conservative conventions and how it spends an estimated $3.5 billion."
