Jarod Wilson, author of the renowned '[Fedora MythTV Setup Guide](http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/)' (_a.k.a. "Jarod's Guide"_) is now author of a **book** "[Hacking MythTV](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470037873/themythofhdtv-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&adid=0SCSXSEW6R0G3XBNR4Q9&link_code=as1)" soon to be available.

I haven't read the book but if Jarod's writing and technical ability come through in the book half as well as his guide, then it should be very well received.  
  
Good Luck Jarod!
