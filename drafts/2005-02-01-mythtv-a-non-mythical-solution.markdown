# MythTV ... a non-mythical solution

Shelly Palmer, Chairman of the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences has [blogged](http://advancedmediacommittee.typepad.com/emmyadvancedmedia/2005/01/mythtv_a_nonmyt.html) about the NYT article on MythTV. It is a very well written commentary on why the Television Industry needs to change in order to survive, or more importantly, prosper.  
  
My opinion is that technology is an enabler, and it is allowing the network executives and the industry at-large to get a free glimpse at the future of television. They can either be a part of it, or fight it (read: RIAA). Unfortunately, the trend is to treat customers like criminals.  
  
A great quote from the blog:  

>   
> So, the problem really isn't the technology. The problem is that the TV industry has been enjoying a technological monopoly for so long that it has forgotten how to serve its customers.
