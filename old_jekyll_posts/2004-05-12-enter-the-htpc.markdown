After researching the ins and outs of HDTV, I decided that building my own Home Theater PC was the way to go. No, really... Stop laughing. I could put the whole thing together really cheaply, and it would have more features than you can imagine! I found this amazing front-end called [MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/). MythTV is like a free version of TiVo with even more functionality. It all runs on Linux, and is quite stable.
