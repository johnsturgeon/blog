I've finally finished putting together my new backend system. I went slightly over my $1,000 budget, but was pretty close.  

  
- Three HD-3000 tuners  
    
- 960 Gbytes of disk space  
    
- FC4  
    
- MythTV (18.1)  
    

  
After getting through some initial issues with my hardware, everything has been working flawlessly. I was able to keep the cost down by going with a \*CHEAP\* video card (it's just a backend afterall), slower processer, less memory, etc... And the installation time was **_fast_** because I didn't have to configure all of the frontend stuff (lirc, alsa, xorg.conf modelines, etc...)
