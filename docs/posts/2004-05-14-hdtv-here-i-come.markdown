# HDTV Here I come?

In my continued quest to create a completely usable HDTV tuner, I am getting closer. 
Tonight, I have a 'cable guy' coming over to install my UHF attic antenna. 
At first, I (naively) thought that I could do it, but going up two stories, drilling, 
wiring, cabling, and digging through mountains of attic insulation is not my cup of tea.  
  
Once the attic antenna is installed, I should be able to get a reliable DTV signal, 
then I can focus on getting my system tweaked to decode and display TV.
