# Hitachiâ€™s DV-DH1000W, a terabyte hi-def DVR with DVD recorder

While this device has not hit the streets in the U.S. I still can't get over the fact that I've been sitting on an over 1TB HD PVR/DVR DVD Recorder for well over a year now (thank you MythTV) that outstrips every feature I've seen yet in a consumer set top box, and allows me to do whatever I want with the content.
