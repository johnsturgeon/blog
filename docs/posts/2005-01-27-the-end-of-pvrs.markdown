# The end of PVR's?

Stand up and take a bow Telesales Broadband (UK Broadband company), the company is investing Â£20 million in the development of TV-on-demand and personal video recorder (PVR) services in 2005. This appears to be a first step in TV-on-demand.

I can only hope that US cable companies get it, and begin to consider long term solutions to a 'PVR in every home'. PVR's are great inventions, MythTV has revolutionized the way that I view television, but they could very well become extinct if TV-on-demand ever becomes a reality. Comcast is piloting their Video-on-demand solutions in several regions throughout the U.S. but the content is usually only available for 24 hours after broadcast. It's a nice start, but hardly 'on demand'.
