# Bringing old blog posts over to new blog

I'm retiring my old wordpress blog (used to be [http://myhdbox.com](http://myhdbox.com){:target="_blank"}), and now I begin the slow process of migrating each post over.  

<!-- more -->
There are a lot of guides, and a lot of ways to automatically pull posts over, but to be honest, I prefer a nice, slow, manual process where I can curate the `frontmatter` and make sure that the posts look good before bringing them over.

That's why I chose this method: [Convert WordPress to Markdown - wpXSS](https://wpxss.com/wp-content/convert-wordpress-to-markdown/){:target="_blank"}

So, over the next few days / weeks I'll be bringing over all 93 posts over the last 18 years :)
