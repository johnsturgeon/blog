# Building your own Linux Media Center?  Try MythTV first.

I was over at [linux.com](http://linux.com/){:target="_blank"}, and there was an article about [building your own Linux Home Media Center](http://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/01/04/1855257&tid=39){:target="_blank"}. It makes me realize that there is a strong perception that MythTV is **hard**. And while it can be difficult/challenging, and yes... _hard_. It can also be used in a simple way as just a Media Center with no recording (_no backend capabilities_). I would strongly suggest anybody considering rolling their own media center give the MythTV route a shot first, because it's such a short jump to wanting a full-fledged PVR, and MythTV is up to the task.  
  
Good Luck folks
