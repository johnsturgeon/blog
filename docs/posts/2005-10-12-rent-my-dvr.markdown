    **Q. What does the TV networks have to say?**  

    A. According to fox networks it is OK to ask a friend or co-worker to tape video shows for you. We at www.rentmydvr.com are all friends.  

They will not store old episodes of shows and re-distribute them, instead they state that you can only ask somebody to record a future showing. The lawyers are going to have fun with this one.
