# Microstar Mega Sky 580 from MSI for £30.

[HD capable, USB 2.0 DVB](https://web.archive.org/web/20080305002834/http://www.pvrwire.com/2006/04/09/sub-30-digital-tv-mini-receiver-hdtv-ready-pvr/) tuner for under £30. Wow... I'm not sure if any Linux Drivers would support this, but I love the idea of the HDTV PC tuner coming down in price.
