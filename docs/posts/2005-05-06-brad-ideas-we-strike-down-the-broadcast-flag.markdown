# Brad Ideas: We strike down the broadcast flag!

Happy Happy day! As Brad Templeton writes:

    On both a personal and professional note, I am happy to report that the federal courts have unanimously ruled to strike down the FCC's broadcast flag (that's a PDF) due to our lawsuit against them.

This is huge. I'm not quite sure that it's over yet. I'm inclined to think that there will be appeals, but at this point, things are looking up.  
  
Congratulations, and thanks go to [Brad Templeton](http://ideas.4brad.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Wendy Seltzer](http://wendy.seltzer.org/){:target="_blank"} (and all the other folks at the EFF who worked their tails off for this result).
