# New 3-tuner HD backend system finally up

I've finally finished putting together my new backend system. I went slightly over my $1,000 budget, but was pretty close.

<!-- more -->

  
- Three HD-3000 tuners
- 960 Gb of disk space
- FC4
- MythTV (18.1)  

After getting through some initial issues with my hardware, everything has been working flawlessly. I was able to keep the cost down by going with a *CHEAP* video card (it's just a backend after all), slower processor, less memory, etc... And the installation time was **_fast_** because I didn't have to configure all the frontend stuff (lirc, alsa, xorg.conf modelines, etc...)
