# Where to start?

This is the first post, so I figure I should probably start out with a bit of history. Ann and I bought a big TV... You know, one of those honkers that owns a corner of your family room. I don't think we ever thought we would do that, but here we are. During the research process for the new TV I ran across this thing called HDTV. In a nutshell, HDTV is High Definition Television, and it is going to be part of our broadcast standard in the not so distant future. I quickly realized that in order for us to take full advantage of the large TV that we would need to get this thing called HDTV.
