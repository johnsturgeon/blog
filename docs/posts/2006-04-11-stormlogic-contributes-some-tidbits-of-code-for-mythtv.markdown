# StormLogic contributes some tidbits of code for MythTV

I just ran across this site: [StormLogic, LLC's MythTV Store - Contributed Code](https://web.archive.org/web/20081221002316/http://mythic.tv/contributed_code.php){:target="_blank"} (archive link) where there are a few bits of interesting code for MythTV.  
  
The two I find the most interesting are DVB Fixer Scripts:  

!!! abstract "DVB Fixer Script"

    "DVB fixer scripts v1.1, used to automate the manual process of using an HD-3000 card with the DVB drivers"  

  
!!! abstract "mplayer-resume.pl"  

    "mplayer-resumer.pl, a wrapper for mplayer that remembers where you left off."  

  
  
When much of my time watching transcoded HDTV shows was spent using mplayer instead of the internal player, I was always frustrated by the lack of a 'bookmark' capability in mplayer. The mplayer-resume.pl script is a nice workaround to that problem.
