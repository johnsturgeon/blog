# HDTV Viewing update

Not much earth-shattering to report here. The good news is that I have been recording like a madman, and trying to perfect the process before the new fall season begins. I think I have a pretty good process down at this point.  
<!-- more -->

First, I record the shows (duh), then I use ProjectX to [demux](http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/terms/demux.cfm){:target="_blank"} them, then I use transcode to [multiplex](http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/terms/multiplexing.cfm){:target="_blank"} them back together and convert them from MPEG-2 to MPEG-4 (ffmpeg XviD codec) with a lower resolution. This might all seem terribly complex at first, but it's really quite simple, and the result is a file that comes in at 10% the size of the HD counterpart, and the viewing quality is almost as good.
