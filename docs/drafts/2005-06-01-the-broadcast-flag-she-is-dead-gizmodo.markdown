# The Broadcast Flag, She Is Dead : Gizmodo

Maybe it shouldn't -- but it kinda surprises me how quickly this saga seems to be coming to resolution, but the broadcast flag appears to be dead for good. And we have a republican from Texas to thank?

>   
> A new Congressional Research Service report raises concerns that the broadcast flag's technological limitations could hinder activities normally deemed "fair use" under copyright law. For instance, students might not be able to email themselves copies of projects incorporating digital video content because no secure system exists for email transmission. "The goal of the flag was not to impede a consumer's ability to copy or use content lawfully in the home, nor was the policy intended to 'foreclose use of the Internet to send digital broadcast content where it can be adequately protected from indiscriminate redistribution,'" the report said, quoting from the FCC order.
